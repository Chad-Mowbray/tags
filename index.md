# The Essence of git

As a devops profession with decades of experience in version control, I was first introduced to git by developers who were bringing it into the company.  I learned a few basic commands, but it wasn't really clicking for me, and I had to ask for help whenever I got in trouble (which was annoyingly often!)  Finally after a couple of years I grew weary of memorizing magic spells and decided to learn the basics of git "once and for all".

In this hands-on, two-session course, we cover the essence of git, laying a foundation for making you productive in a professional environment, regardless of the specific workflow in use.

I've taught this material to every CodePlatoon cohort since Bravo. Several graduates have reported that, equipped with a firm grasp of these basics, they have gone on to become go-to resources for git knowledge in their teams.

Make sure you are familiar with the material in the [Prework](prework-and-references), or you are very likely going to be lost during the sessions.  (The "References" material is helpful but not essential for this course).
