# The Essence of git

As a devops professional with decades of experience in version control, I first experienced git from developers bringing it into the company.  I learned a few basic commands, but it wasn't really clicking for me. Annoyingly often, I got in trouble and had to ask for help.  After a couple of years I wearied of memorizing magic spells and decided to learn the basics of git once-and-for-all.

In this hands-on, two-session course, we cover the essence of git, laying a foundation for making you productive in a professional environment, regardless of the specific workflow in use.

As of this writing (Spring 2020), I've taught this material to CodePlatoon cohorts Bravo thru Kilo. Graduates report that, equipped with a firm grasp of these basics, some of them have become go-to git resources in their software engineering teams.

Familiarizing with the material in the [Prework](prework-and-references) will help guard against getting lost during the sessions.  (The "References" material is helpful but not essential for this course).
