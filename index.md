# Collaborating with git

## Introduction

As a devops professional with three-ish decades of experience in version control, I first experienced git in 2009 when developers began using it in my company.  I learned a few basic survival commands, but it wasn't really clicking for me. Depressingly often (especially for a version control "expert"!) I got out of my depth and had to ask for help.  After a couple of years I wearied of memorizing magic spells and decided to learn the basics of git once-and-for-all.

In this two-session hands-on course, we experience the essence of git by working in teams to improve a simple Python webapp, laying a foundation for collaborating in a professional environment.

I've taught this material to every CodePlatoon cohort since Bravo. Several graduates report that, equipped with a firm grasp of these git basics, they have become go-to git resources in their software engineering teams.

## Tips for Success
- **Prework** - The class moves really fast, especially if you haven't done much with git, Bash, Peewee and/or Flask.  Doing the Prework is essential to help you keep up and get the most out of the time.
- **Stop me and ask questions** - Really.  It helps me know how things are going.  More often that not, mustering the courage to speak up in a classroom environment ends up helping many others in the class.

## Session One - Explore the Tags app, Linux/Bash, and Git; set up your team
