In this hands-on, two-session course, we will cover the essence of git, laying a foundation for making you productive in a professional environment, regardless of the specific workflow in use.

Growing weary of the memorizing-magic-spells approach to git, I was personally motivated to learn the basics of git "once and for all".

I've taught this material to every CodePlatoon cohort since Bravo. Several graduates have reported that, equipped with a firm grasp of these basics, they have gone on to become go-to resources for git knowledge in their teams.

Make sure you are familiar with the material in the "Prework", or you are very likely going to be lost during the sessions.  (The "References" material is helpful but not essential for this course).
