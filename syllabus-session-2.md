### "I need to pull in changes from another branch" - [git merge](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging#_basic_merging){:target="_blank"}

### "I only want to bring in one commit" - [git cherry-pick](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Appendix-C:-Git-Commands-Patching){:target="_blank"}

### "I need to clean up my commit history before I push" - [git rebase](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing){:target="_blank"}
