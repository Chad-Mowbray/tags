Quick Reference of material covered
===================================

The Three Objects - commit, tree, blob
-----------------------
- These are all "SHA's"

The Three Trees (NOTE: 'tree' as used here is not exactly the same as the 'tree' object type)
-----------------------
- 1 - workspace
- 2 - index
- 3 - current commit (aka what HEAD is pointing to)

Which tree(s) does each of these commands modify?
$ git reset --soft  HEAD^
$ git reset --mixed HEAD^
$ git reset --hard  HEAD^
    
Git has your back.  SHAs don't go away just because you stop pointing to them.  You can find them again and 'tag' them by attaching a branch to them.
$ git reflog
$ git branch aBranchName some-sha

Git workflow operations
-----------------------
fix branch - "I wish I'd committed this stuff on another branch".  Use git reset to 'uncommit', stash, and then move to desired branch and "stash pop".
$ git reset HEAD^
$ git stash
$ git checkout other-branch
$ git stash pop
<now commit it again>

git stash

git merge

git cherry-pick

git rebase -i

git bisect



Some Linux/bash items to explore
===================================
You will need to know a command-line editor that doesn't need installing first.
Be your own best friend and learn vim.  Or emacs.

grep - "Get Regular Expression and Print" - find patterns in a file, or files in a directory tree

bash - It's an entire programming language, and much more.  To go really far, look at zsh.
